# souschef
A recipe creation and organization tool focused on the user experience.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Install the CLI (optional)

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Foundation for Sites project with this template:

```bash
foundation new --framework sites --template basic
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

### Install and Use this Project

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/natashadecoste/souschef.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd souschef
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.

**note** it runs on localhost:3000 not 8000
